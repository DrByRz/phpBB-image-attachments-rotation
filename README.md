# phpBB_image_rotation

# Installation
Copy the "w3all" folder into phpBB/ext/

So you'll have: phpBB/ext/w3all/w3imagerotation

Go to "ACP" > "Customise" > "Extensions" and enable the "Attachments images rotation" extension.

Works for jpg/jpeg, gif and png

You may wish to know better how it works, so temporary, please check this post:
